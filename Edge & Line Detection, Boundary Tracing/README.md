This section of the repository covers the following tasks:

Task 1.1. Implementing a sobel filter and visualizing the gradient magnitude as an image and the orientation in the form of quiver plot.

Task 1.2. Implementing a boundary tracer to extract the outer boundaries of each and every object present in an image.

Task 2. Implementing a function to automatically identity corner points in an image using Harris Corner Detection algorithm.

Task 3. Implement a function to automatically detect shapes in an image using Hough Transform algorithms for lines.
