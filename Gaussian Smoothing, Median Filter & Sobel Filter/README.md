This section of the repository covers the following questions:

Q1. Visualizing the effects of Upsampling and Downsampling a given image.


Q2. Visualizing the effects of Gaussian Smoothing an image by a) Increasing the Kernel size of the filter while keeping the value of sigma(standard deviation) fixed i.e. sigma = 1 and b) Increasing the value of sigma while keeping the kernel size of the filter = 11 x 11.

Q3. Visualizing the effect of Gaussian Smoothing while Upsampling/Downsampling vs. using median filtering for the same.

Q4. Visualizing the effect of performing a Gaussian Smoothing on a Noisy Image vs. performing median filtering on the same image.

Q5. Implementing a sobel filter and visualizing its results as a coloured image using the HSV color model.
